# bbc_clean: basic image editing of the Bolton-Brush Collection

Tools to modify the scanned images in such a way as to make them consistent. The x-ray films have been scanned manually by humans, withouth making use of a dedicated tool. This has caused the images to be stored in different orientations, sometimes some images might have been scanned with inverted grayscales. All images of the same type should have the same orientation, size and color map (black on white or white on black).
